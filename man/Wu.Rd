\title{Wu's resistance matrix}
\description{
  Returns a matrix \code{M} with \code{M[i,j]} is the resistance between
  nodes \code{i} and \code{j}.
}
\usage{
Wu(L)
}

\arguments{
  \item{L}{Laplacian conductance matrix}
}
\details{
  Evaluates Wu's resistance matrix, as per his theorem on page 6656.
}
\value{
  Returns a matrix of the same size as \code{L}, but whose elements are
  the effective resistance between the nodes.

\note{
    In the function, the sum is not from 2 to \code{n} as in Wu, but
    from 1 to \eqn{n-1}{n-1}, because \code{eigen()}  orders the
    eigenvalues from largest to smallest, not smallest to largest.
