\title{Mensurates a circuit given potentials of some nodes}
\description{
Given a conductance matrix and a vector of potentials or current input
values at each node (\code{NA} being interpreted as \dQuote{unknown}),
this function determines the potentials and currents over the whole
circuit.  
}
\usage{
circuit(L, v, currents=0, give.internal)
}
\arguments{
  \item{L}{Conductance matrix}
  \item{v}{Vector of potentials; one element per node of the conductance
    matrix.   Elements with \code{NA} are interpreted
    as \dQuote{free} nodes, that is, nodes that are not kept at a fixed
    potential.  The potential of these nodes is well defined by the other
    nodes in the problem}
  \item{currents}{Vector of currents fed into each node.  The only

    elements of this vector that are used are those that correspond to a
    node with free potential (use \code{NA} for nodes that are at a
    specified potential).  The idea is that each node has
    \strong{either} a specified voltage, \strong{or} a specified current
    is fed into it; not both.

    Observe that feeding zero current into a node at free potential is
    perfectly acceptable (and the usual case).}

  \item{give.internal}{Boolean, with \code{TRUE} meaning to return also
    a matrix showing the node to node currents, and default \code{FALSE}
    meaning to omit this.}
}
\value{A list of 2 or 4 elements, depending on  argument
  \code{give.internal} is \code{FALSE} or \code{TRUE}.
  \item{potentials}{A vector of potentials.  Note that the potentials of the
    nodes whose potential was specified by input argument \code{v}
    retain their original potentials; symbolically
    \code{all(potentials[!is.na(v)] == v[!is.na(v)])}.}
  \item{currents}{Vector of currents required to maintain the system
    with the potentials specified by input argument \code{v}}
  \item{internal.currents}{Matrix showing current flow from node to
    node.  Element \code{[i,j]} shows current flow from node \code{i} to
    node \code{j}.}
  \item{power}{The power dissipated at each edge}
  \item{total.power}{Total power dissipated over the resistor network}
}

\examples{

#reproduce first example on ?cube:
v <- c(0,rep(NA,5),1,NA)
circuit(cube(),v)
circuit(cube(),v+1000)

#  problem: The nodes  of a skeleton cube are at potentials
#  1,2,3,... volts.  What current is needed to maintain this?  Ans:
circuit(cube(),1:8)


#sanity check: maintain one node at 101 volts:
circuit(cube(),c(rep(NA,7),101))

#now, nodes 1-4 have potential 1,2,3,4 volts.  Nodes 5-8 each have one
#Amp shoved in them.  What is the potential of nodes 5-8, and what
#current is needed to maintain nodes 1-4 at their potential?
# Answer:
v <- c(1:4,rep(NA,4))
currents <- c(rep(NA,4),rep(1,4))
circuit(cube(),v,currents)
